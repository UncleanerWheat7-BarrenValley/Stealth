/*
 * Single scattering
 * 
 * The single scattered radiance is the light arriving from the Sun at some
 * point after exactly one scattering event inside the atmosphere (which can be due
 * to air molecules or aerosol particles; we exclude reflections from the ground,
 * computed <a href="#irradiance">separately</a>). The following sections describe
 * how we compute it, how we store it in a precomputed texture, and how we read it
 * back.
 * 
 * Computation
 * 
 * Consider the Sun light scattered at a point q by air molecules before
 * arriving at another point p (for aerosols, replace "Rayleigh" with "Mie").
 * 
 * The radiance arriving at $\bp$ is the product of:
 * 
 * the solar irradiance at the top of the atmosphere,
 * the transmittance between the Sun and q (i.e. the fraction of the Sun
 * light at the top of the atmosphere that reaches q),
 * the Rayleigh scattering coefficient at q (i.e. the fraction of the
 * light arriving at q which is scattered, in any direction),
 * the Rayleigh phase function (i.e. the fraction of the scattered light at
 * q which is actually scattered towards p),
 * the transmittance between q and p (i.e. the fraction of the light
 * scattered at q towards p that reaches p).
 * 
 * Thus, by noting w_s the unit direction vector towards the Sun, and with
 * the following definitions:
 * 
 * <li>$r=\Vert\bo\bp\Vert$,</li>
 * <li>$d=\Vert\bp\bq\Vert$,</li>
 * <li>$\mu=(\bo\bp\cdot\bp\bq)/rd$,</li>
 * <li>$\mu_s=(\bo\bp\cdot\bw_s)/r$,</li>
 * <li>$\nu=(\bp\bq\cdot\bw_s)/d$</li>
 * 
 * the values of r and mu_s for q are
 * 
 * <li>$r_d=\Vert\bo\bq\Vert=\sqrt{d^2+2r\mu d +r^2}$,</li>
 * <li>$\mu_{s,d}=(\bo\bq\cdot\bw_s)/r_d=((\bo\bp+\bp\bq)\cdot\bw_s)/r_d=
 * (r\mu_s + d\nu)/r_d$</li>
 * 
 * and the Rayleigh and Mie single scattering components can be computed as follows
 * (note that we omit the solar irradiance and the phase function terms, as well as
 * the scattering coefficients at the bottom of the atmosphere - we add them later
 * on for efficiency reasons):

 * improvements (refer to the paper and to the above figures for the notations):
 * 
 * the mapping for mu takes the minimal distance to the nearest atmosphere
 * boundary into account, to map mu to the full [0,1]$ interval (the original
 * mapping was not covering the full [0,1] interval).
 * the mapping for mu_s is more generic than in the paper (the original
 * mapping was using ad-hoc constants chosen for the Earth atmosphere case). It is
 * based on the distance to the top atmosphere boundary (for the sun rays), as for
 * the mu mapping, and uses only one ad-hoc (but configurable) parameter. Yet,
 * as the original definition, it provides an increased sampling rate near the
 * horizon.

/*
 * Multiple scattering
 * 
 * The multiply scattered radiance is the light arriving from the Sun at some
 * point in the atmosphere after two or more bounces (where a bounce is
 * either a scattering event or a reflection from the ground). The following
 * sections describe how we compute it, how we store it in a precomputed texture,
 * and how we read it back.
 * 
 * Note that, as for single scattering, we exclude here the light paths whose
 * last bounce is a reflection on the ground. The contribution from these
 * paths is computed separately, at rendering time, in order to take the actual
 * ground albedo into account (for intermediate reflections on the ground, which
 * are precomputed, we use an average, uniform albedo).
 * 
 * Computation
 * 
 * Multiple scattering can be decomposed into the sum of double scattering,
 * triple scattering, etc, where each term corresponds to the light arriving from
 * the Sun at some point in the atmosphere after exactly 2, 3, etc bounces.
 * Moreover, each term can be computed from the previous one. Indeed, the light
 * arriving at some point p from direction w after n bounces is an
 * integral over all the possible points q for the last bounce, which involves
 * the light arriving at q from any direction, after n-1 bounces.
 * 
 * This description shows that each scattering order requires a triple integral
 * to be computed from the previous one (one integral over all the points q
 * on the segment from p to the nearest atmosphere boundary in direction w,
 * and a nested double integral over all directions at each point q).
 * Therefore, if we wanted to compute each order "from scratch", we would need a
 * triple integral for double scattering, a sextuple integral for triple
 * scattering, etc. This would be clearly inefficient, because of all the redundant
 * computations (the computations for order n would basically redo all the
 * computations for all previous orders, leading to quadratic complexity in the
 * total number of orders). Instead, it is much more efficient to proceed as
 * follows:
 * 
 * precompute single scattering in a texture (as described above), for n^2:
 * 
 * precompute the n-th scattering in a texture, with a triple integral whose
 * integrand uses lookups in the (n-1)-th scattering texture
 * 
 * This strategy avoids many redundant computations but does not eliminate all
 * of them. Consider for instance the points p and p' in the figure below,
 * and the computations which are necessary to compute the light arriving at these
 * two points from direction w after n bounces. These computations involve,
 * in particular, the evaluation of the radiance L which is scattered at q in
 * direction -w, and coming from all directions after n-1 bounces:
 * 
 * 
 * Therefore, if we computed the n-th scattering with a triple integral as
 * described above, we would compute L redundantly (in fact, for all points p
 * between q and the nearest atmosphere boundary in direction -w). To avoid
 * this, and thus increase the efficiency of the multiple scattering computations,
 * we refine the above algorithm as follows:
 * 
 * precompute single scattering in a texture (as described above),for n^2:
 * 
 * for each point q and direction w, precompute the light which is
 * scattered at q towards direction -w, coming from any direction after
 * n-1 bounces (this involves only a double integral, whose integrand uses
 * lookups in the (n-1)-th scattering texture),
 * for each point p and direction w, precompute the light coming from
 * direction w after n bounces (this involves only a single integral, whose
 * integrand uses lookups in the texture computed at the previous line)
 * 
 * To get a complete algorithm, we must now specify how we implement the two
 * steps in the above loop. This is what we do in the rest of this section.
 * 
 * First step
 * 
 * The first step computes the radiance which is scattered at some point q
 * inside the atmosphere, towards some direction -w. Furthermore, we assume
 * that this scattering event is the n-th bounce.
 * 
 * This radiance is the integral over all the possible incident directions
 * w_i, of the product of
 * 
 * the incident radiance L_i arriving at q from direction w_i after
 * n-1 bounces, which is the sum of:
 * 
 * a term given by the precomputed scattering texture for the (n-1)-th
 * order,
 * if the ray [q, w_i) intersects the ground at r, the contribution
 * from the light paths with n-1 bounces and whose last bounce is at r, i.e.
 * on the ground (these paths are excluded, by definition, from our precomputed
 * textures, but we must take them into account here since the bounce on the ground
 * is followed by a bounce at q). This contribution, in turn, is the product
 * of:
 * 
 * the transmittance between q and r,
 * the (average) ground albedo,
 * the <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smr/cs348c-97/surveypaper.html"
 * >Lambertian BRDF</a> $1/\pi$,
 * the irradiance received on the ground after n-2 bounces. We explain in the
 * <a href="#irradiance">next section</a> how we precompute it in a texture. For

 * Second step
 *

 * after n bounces, using a texture precomputed with the previous function.
 * 
 * This radiance is the integral over all points q between p and the
 * nearest atmosphere boundary in direction w of the product of:
 * 
 * a term given by a texture precomputed with the previous function, namely
 * the radiance scattered at q towards p, coming from any direction after
 * n-1 bounces, the transmittance betweeen p and q
 * 
 * Note that this excludes the light paths with n bounces and whose last
 * bounce is on the ground, on purpose. Indeed, we chose to exclude these paths
 * from our precomputed textures so that we can compute them at render time
 * instead, using the actual ground albedo.
 * 
 * The implementation for this second step is straightforward:
