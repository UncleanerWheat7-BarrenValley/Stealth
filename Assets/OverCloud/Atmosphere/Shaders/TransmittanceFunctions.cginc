 * Transmittance
 *
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmittance
 *
 * As the light travels from a point p to a point q in the atmosphere,
 * it is partially absorbed and scattered out of its initial direction because of
 * the air molecules and the aerosol particles. Thus, the light arriving at q
 * is only a fraction of the light from p, and this fraction, which depends on
 * wavelength, is called the transmittance. The following sections describe how 
 * we compute it, how we store it in a precomputed
 * texture, and how we read it back.
 *
 * Computation
 *
 * For 3 aligned points p, q and r inside the atmosphere, in this
 * order, the transmittance between p and r is the product of the
 * transmittance between p and q and between q and r.
 * In particular, the transmittance between p and q is the transmittance
 * between p and the nearest intersection i of the half-line [p,q]
 * with the top or bottom atmosphere boundary, divided by the transmittance between
 * q and i (or 0 if the segment [p,q] intersects the ground).
 *
 * Also, the transmittance between p and q and between q and p
 * are the same. Thus, to compute the transmittance between arbitrary points, it
 * is sufficient to know the transmittance between a point p in the atmosphere,
 * and points i on the top atmosphere boundary. This transmittance depends on
 * only two parameters, which can be taken as the radius $r=\Vert\bo\bp\Vert$ and
 * the cosine of the "view zenith angle",
 * $\mu=\bo\bp\cdot\bp\bi/\Vert\bo\bp\Vert\Vert\bp\bi\Vert$. To compute it, we
 * first need to compute the length $\Vert\bp\bi\Vert$, and we need to know when
 * the segment [p,i] intersects the ground.
 *
 * Distance to the top atmosphere boundary
 *
 * A point at distance d from p along [p,i] has coordinates
 * $[d\sqrt{1-\mu^2}, r+d\mu]^\top$, whose squared norm is $d^2+2r\mu d+r^2$.
 * Thus, by definition of i, we have
 * $\Vert\bp\bi\Vert^2+2r\mu\Vert\bp\bi\Vert+r^2=r_{\mathrm{top}}^2$,
 * from which we deduce the length $\Vert\bp\bi\Vert$:

 * segment [p,i], as well as the integral of the number density of aerosols
 * and the integral of the number density of air molecules that absorb light
 * (e.g. ozone) - along the same segment. These 3 integrals have the same form and,
 * when the segment [p,i] does not intersect the ground, they can be computed
 * numerically with the help of the following auxilliary function using the trapezoidal rule.

 * Precomputation
 *
 * The above function is quite costly to evaluate, and a lot of evaluations are
 * needed to compute single and multiple scattering. Fortunately this function
 * depends on only two parameters and is quite smooth, so we can precompute it in a
 * small 2D texture to optimize its evaluation.
 * 
 * For this we need a mapping between the function parameters (r,mu) and the
 * texture coordinates (u,v), and vice-versa, because these parameters do not
 * have the same units and range of values. And even if it was the case, storing a
 * function f from the [0,1] interval in a texture of size n would sample the
 * function at 0.5/n, 1.5/n, ... (n-0.5)/n, because texture samples are at
 * the center of texels. Therefore, this texture would only give us extrapolated
 * function values at the domain boundaries (0 and 1). To avoid this we need
 * to store f(0) at the center of texel 0 and f(1) at the center of texel
 * n-1. This can be done with the following mapping from values x in [0,1] to
 * texture coordinates u in [0.5/n,1-0.5/n] - and its inverse:

 * we use the same mapping for r, and a slightly improved mapping for mu
 * (considering only the case where the view ray does not intersect the ground).

 * Finally, we will also need the transmittance between a point in the
