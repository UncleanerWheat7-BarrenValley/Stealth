 * Ground irradiance
 * 
 * The ground irradiance is the Sun light received on the ground after n \ge 0
 * bounces (where a bounce is either a scattering event or a reflection on the
 * ground). We need this for two purposes:
 * 
 * while precomputing the n-th order of scattering, with n \ge 2, in order
 * to compute the contribution of light paths whose (n-1)-th bounce is on the
 * ground (which requires the ground irradiance after n-2 bounces - see the Multiple
 * scattering section),
 * at rendering time, to compute the contribution of light paths whose last
 * bounce is on the ground (these paths are excluded, by definition, from our
 * precomputed scattering textures)
 * 
 * In the first case we only need the ground irradiance for horizontal surfaces
 * at the bottom of the atmosphere (during precomputations we assume a perfectly
 * spherical ground with a uniform albedo). In the second case, however, we need
 * the ground irradiance for any altitude and any surface normal, and we want to
 * precompute it for efficiency. In fact, as described in our
 * <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00288758/en">paper</a> we precompute it only
 * for horizontal surfaces, at any altitude (which requires only 2D textures,
 * instead of 4D textures for the general case), and we use approximations for
 * non-horizontal surfaces.
 * 
 * The following sections describe how we compute the ground irradiance, how we
 * store it in a precomputed texture, and how we read it back.
 * 
 * Computation
 * 
 * The ground irradiance computation is different for the direct irradiance,
 * i.e. the light received directly from the Sun, without any intermediate bounce,
 * and for the indirect irradiance (at least one bounce). We start here with the
 * direct irradiance.
 * 
 * The irradiance is the integral over an hemisphere of the incident radiance,
 * times a cosine factor. For the direct ground irradiance, the incident radiance
 * is the Sun radiance at the top of the atmosphere, times the transmittance
 * through the atmosphere. And, since the Sun solid angle is small, we can
 * approximate the transmittance with a constant, i.e. we can move it outside the
 * irradiance integral, which can be performed over (the visible fraction of) the
 * Sun disc rather than the hemisphere. Then the integral becomes equivalent to the
 * ambient occlusion due to a sphere, also called a view factor, which is given in
 * <a href="http://webserver.dmt.upm.es/~isidoro/tc3/Radiation%20View%20factors.pdf
 * ">Radiative view factors</a> (page 10). For a small solid angle, these complex
 * equations can be simplified as follows:

/*
 * For the indirect ground irradiance the integral over the hemisphere must be
 * computed numerically. More precisely we need to compute the integral over all
 * the directions w of the hemisphere, of the product of:
 * 
 * the radiance arriving from direction w after n bounces,
 * the cosine factor, i.e. omega_z
 * 
 * This leads to the following implementation (where
