  * Rendering
  *
  * Here we assume that the transmittance, scattering and irradiance textures
  * have been precomputed, and we provide functions using them to compute the sky
  * color, the aerial perspective, and the ground radiance.
  *
  * More precisely, we assume that the single Rayleigh scattering, without its
  * phase function term, plus the multiple scattering terms (divided by the Rayleigh
  * phase function for dimensional homogeneity) are stored in a
  * scattering_texture. We also assume that the single Mie scattering
  * is stored, without its phase function term:
  *
  * either separately, in a single_mie_scattering_texture (this
  * option was not provided our <a href=
  * "http://evasion.inrialpes.fr/~Eric.Bruneton/PrecomputedAtmosphericScattering2.zip"
  * >original implementation</a>),
  * or, if the COMBINED_SCATTERING_TEXTURES preprocessor
  * macro is defined, in the scattering_texture. In this case, which is
  * only available with a GLSL compiler, Rayleigh and multiple scattering are stored
  * in the RGB channels, and the red component of the single Mie scattering is
  * stored in the alpha channel).
  *
  * In the second case, the green and blue components of the single Mie
  * scattering are extrapolated as described in our
  * <a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00288758/en">paper</a>, with the following
